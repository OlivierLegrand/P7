School participation in household surveys and censuses is commonly measured by whether pupils or students attended a given grade or level of education at least one day during the academic reference year. Therefore, indicators of school participation derived from household survey data refer to attendance, e.g. “net attendance rate” or “adjusted net attendance rate”. The comparable indicator for administrative data is \"Adjusted net enrolment rate, primary\" because the data is based on numbers of students officially enrolled in educational institutions in the stated year.
